The current stronghold of [[Urshim/Thidopem/index|Thidopem]] against the aggressive expansion of [[The Drundeic Empire]].

# History
Hastily constructed at the westernmost pass of the [[Ledulem Peaks|Ledulem Peaks]], this fort is only barely resisting the advance of [[The Drundeic Empire|Drundejun]]. It was constructed in the 4th of Mirtul, 1489, which at time of writing was just over a year ago. 

# Appearance
Sturdy walls hide a poorly equipped and poorly stocked resistance. There is but a single trebuchet. It is clear that the advantage of the difficult terrain is largely responsible for the continued persistence of the fort.
