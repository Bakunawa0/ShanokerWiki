A mountain range which largely blocks passage to the peninsula of [[Urshim/Thidopem/index|Thidopem]]. It runs W-E with a narrow pass on its western extreme which holds the fortress of [[Pathalje]]. 

# Subterranean Features
For as long as people have existed to either side of the peaks, there have been efforts to forge more paths through them. The singular natural passage through it is busy and not without danger. Prior to the building of Pathalje, the pass was a popular ambush location, and caravans knew to travel with extreme caution and stealth in this area. 

Due to these factors, the caves were explored and dungeons were dug into the rock in an effort to break through to the other side. These efforts invariably failed, as the strange composition of the stone in the deeper parts of the mountain tends to confuse compasses, leading the excavations astray. The base of the peaks are now littered with entrances to these failures.

With the recent advances of [[The Drundeic Empire]], it is proving fortunate that no other path through the peaks has been forged.
